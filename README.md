This is a simple Python project to construct an Implied Volatility Surface from real time options price data.

The data is sourced from Yahoo Finance through the yfinance package. In the code, the underlying asset is set to "SPX" aka the S&P500.
By changing the label attributed to UNDERLYING in tab 2, we can change this to any asset with available options data.
